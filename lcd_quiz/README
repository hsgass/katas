This week's quiz is to write a program that displays LCD style numbers at adjustable sizes.

The digits to be displayed will be passed as an argument to the program. Size should be
controlled with the command-line option -s follow up by a positive integer. The default value
for -s is 2.

For example, if your program is called with:

> lcd.rb 012345

The correct display is:

 --        --   --        --
|  |    |    |    | |  | |
|  |    |    |    | |  | |
           --   --   --   --
|  |    | |       |    |    |
|  |    | |       |    |    |
 --        --   --        --

And for:

> lcd.rb -s 1 6789

Your program should print:

 -   -   -   -
|     | | | | |
 -       -   -
| |   | | |   |
 -       -   -

Note the single column of space between digits in both examples. For other values of -s, simply
lengthen the - and | bars.
